# Spot Tries To Get Off a Cart
Drop Spot on top of a cart, and make it escape from it


## Failed jump
Tried to stand up really quickly from a sitting position, but the motor seemed not powerful enough.

## Baby crawl
Tried heuristics with the joints, and it walked forward! Ok, "walked" is a bit of a stretch, it crawled forward, seemingly in huge pain. Again the elbow motor seemed too weak.

## Challenge
* Create algo to walk away from the cart (which moves as it has wheels)
